Caravan insurance is a great way to protect your caravan against damage or theft. This project is to anticipate if a customer will buy the caravan insurance policy based on the data provided by the Dutch Mining Company. The KDD process was used to determine the customers that are likely to buy the Caravan Insurance policy. Data mining is used in this endeavor to process the data before comprehending the insights through exploratory data analysis, continuing with feature selection and model building. Various data-mining approaches are combined with sampling methods to obtain the optimum model for prediction, and the best model is picked after comparison. 

In this project, the Dutch Data Mining sentimental research company has provided a dataset in which the task is prediction of a customer buying the caravan insurance. 
We could see 348 customers tend to acquire caravan insurance out of 5822 observations to anticipate probable buyers for the caravan insurance policy from the training data. To improvise the sales and business we have approached the problem with KDD process.
Based on our findings, we recommend that:

1) People having car policy
2) People having fire policy
3) People having moped policies

Are preferred for the final model and better sensitivity with data balancing of 70:30 ratio.
With this feature set,

Se = 0.72
Sp = 0.51
Sp = 0.62
AUC = 0.62
PPV = 0.08

The ROI calculated considering:

a) Caravan insurance = 165 pounds
b) Average profit = 5%
c) Maximum cost for flyer  = 50p 
d) Conversion rate around 5%
e) Average duration = 10years

The ROI is 25.8%
